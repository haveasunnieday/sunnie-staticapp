  <h2>Fear the Kraken</h2>
  <p>Lots of big news this week! We completed our quests in the Tradewinds Skyway. Puerto Mico was an interesting place, but the inhabitants are rather rude. Someone should tell them it’s not wise to anger a pirate who carries some big swords around with them. We tracked down that scurvy pirate Ratbeard and he had Captain Gunn’s gold alright. Sadly for him he made a deal with the wrong Rapa Nui who had him hanging from a rope. Lucky for him we arrived when we did. I wasn’t so sure about his desire to join my crew, but he has actually proven himself to be quite useful. When we arrived in the Tradewinds Skyway we uncovered some surprising news about his former crew. We agreed to help him uncover what happened and I’m actually glad we did. He may not be as bad as we originally thought. But I’m still keeping my eye on him. The biggest adventure in Tradewinds was found in the ancient Gold Mines. Talk about your strange and unique treasures! It was a battle simply to find Gortez, but we did discover an intriguing message in the Crystal Cave. Can’t wait to find out what that was all about.</p>
